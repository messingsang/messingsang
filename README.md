### Hey. You found my github account
feel free to mess around with anything you find here.
The entire history of my website should be available here








EvergreenðŸŽ„ is back on track, yo! 
Currently running Cybercrime Advent Calendars in Danish.
I'm learning every day how to fuck with numbers in an interesting manner, but my github is for hosting my website.
Ask me about intelligence, and what it means.
I'm not difficult to get a hold of.
